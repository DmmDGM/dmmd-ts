# DmmD.ts

## About

A collection of functional and analytical utility tools that I enjoy using in my personal projects. Though the name
suggests the project is designed for `TypeScript`, it contains many features beyond the `Node.js` environment.

Documentation is not yet available, and I do not plan on adding one until I stop becoming lazy or until I actually
add enough stuff to this repository to make a documentation page worth it; whichever comes first, I guess.

But, eh. If you do plan on using this, I've documented and typed everything with TypeScript and JsDoc, so it should
be relatively easy to use as long as you got that sweet intellisense on. Otherwise, feel free to just message me on
Discord: `@therock2t`.

## Installation

I haven't tested this yet.

## Usage

Same as above.
